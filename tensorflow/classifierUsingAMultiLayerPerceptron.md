# Chapter 4 Technical Assessment: Make a Multi-Layered Perceptron for Classification

## Problem Statement

Using the [Fashion MNIST dataset provided](https://storage.googleapis.com/jmstore/TensorFlowJS/EdX/TrainingData/fashion-mnist.js), architect a TensorFlow JS solution using a multi-layer perceptron that can score above 80% accuracy on this data.

### Labels

Each training example is assigned to one of the following numerical output labels representing a different type of clothing.

0. T-shirt/top
1. Trouser
2. Pullover
3. Dress
